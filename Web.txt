ASP.NET MVC
Why did MVC come about? what inspried it?
Why would you use it over web pages? (and visa verca)
What are some every day things that you benfit from when using MVC - how is a devs life better beacause of it?
What are some gotchas?

JAVASCRIPT :
In many languages the curly brace placement is a matter of prefence, in javascript there is a particualr style that is more strongly enforced than in other laguages. 
  What is that style and why is it so strongly enforced by various tools?

Given this block of code:
        $.get(formattedUrl,
             { feedback: self.SelectedFeedback() },
             self.success);

    -What does this block of code do?
    -How could you test that?
    
Given this block of code:
        var myobject = {
                 id:'Freddy', 
                 doSomething: function(){ console.log(this.id);}
                }
        $("#myDomElement").click(myobject.doSomething)

    - what does it do?
    - what do you think the author intended for it to do?
    - how do you solve that problem? (There is  more than one way to skin this cat)

Given this block of code:
        for(var i=0;i<10;i++){
          setTimeout(function(){
            console.log(i);
          },10);
        }

        for(var j=11;j<20;j++){
            console.log(j);
        }
    - what is the expected output? why?
    - what is the threading model in JS (assuming in a browser)
    - how is memory managed in js?

    
REST/HTTP
The boss has told you that you need to provide the ability for a search in your ASP.net site. 
-it needs to search for people on
  the persons name 
    and/or 
  the persons date of birth. 
-It is expected to be exposed via "Restfull API"

What are some of the ways you could do this? 
How would YOU specifically implement this? 
What would a test call look like?
How would you test this?
